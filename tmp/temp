# d61864-genai — Department GenAI Platform SDK

Internal GenAI platform SDK for Department 61864.

This package provides standardized building blocks for developing GenAI applications inside the corporate environment, including:

- Corporate LLM and embedding wrappers
- Authentication and configuration handling
- Evaluation frameworks
- Vector store integrations
- Guardrails and policy enforcement
- Observability and telemetry hooks
- LangGraph memory and checkpoint adapters

The goal is to **avoid re-inventing infrastructure** across teams and to enforce consistent patterns for security, evaluation, and operations.

## 🎯 Design Goals

This SDK is built around:

- **Corporate-first networking** — works with internal LLM gateways and proxies
- **Security by default** — auth, headers, secrets handling
- **Observability-ready** — OpenTelemetry compatible
- **Evaluation-driven** — retriever + generator benchmarks
- **Modular adoption** — install only what you need via extras
- **Stable public API** — safe upgrades for downstream apps
